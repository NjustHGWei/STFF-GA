Abstract:
The field of remote sensing change detection (RSCD) has seen significant advancements recently, focusing on the precise identification and analysis of temporal changes in remote sensing images. Existing deep learning-based RSCD methods primarily rely on concatenation or subtraction to integrate features of bi-temporal images and reconstruct change features through a feature pyramid network decoding architecture. However, these methods face challenges related to inadequate spatio-temporal change representation and insufficient aggregation of multilevel semantic information, resulting in pseudo-changes and poor completeness of detected change objects. In this paper, we propose an innovative RSCD framework via spatio-temporal feature fusion and guide aggregation (STFF-GA) to address the aforementioned challenges. The architecture of this network comprises two key components: the STFF module and the GA module. The STFF module is designed as a low-parameter and low-computation structure, effectively enhancing the representation of spatio-temporal change information through split, interaction, and fusion strategies. The GA module uses deep feature guidance (DFG) mapping as prior information to guide the aggregation of multi-level semantic information, thereby correcting the positional information of change objects and filtering out pseudo-changes and other noise interference. Additionally, it utilizes convolution kernels of various scales to extract fine-grained features, facilitating the complete reconstruction of change objects. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark change detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed STFF-GA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors.
